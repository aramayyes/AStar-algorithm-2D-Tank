# A* algorithm - 2D Tank

This repository contains python implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm and a simple application where that algorithm is used.
The app is made with PyGame, though it's not really a game. 
There is just a tile-map with obstacles and a single tank. 
After selecting a point the shortest path to that point is found using A* algorithm and the tank follows it.
